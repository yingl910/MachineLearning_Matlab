## MachineLearning_Matlab

All codes in this folders are codes for implementing machine learning algorithms in Matlab. 

Almost all codes are implemented in vectorization.

Algorithms cover: 

###Linear Regression:
Cost Function, Gradient Descent, Selecting Learning Rate, Feature Normalization, Normal Equations

###Logistic Regression:
Cost Function and Gradient, Advanced Optimization Function:fminunc, Regularization, Decision Boundary,One-vs-All Classification

###Neural Network (hardest):
Feedforward Propagation, Backpropagation, Gradient checking

These codes are *Programming Assignments* for Stanford Machine Learning course(online) by Dr. Andrew Ng. 

All code here are correct submissions and there are two additional notes:
>Implementation Note: some points that went wrong when i implemented these algorithms and i think you should pay attention to
>Matlab Tutorial: notes taken from matlab tutorial videos, enough for implementing all these algorithms 

I really have lots of fun in this course as well as implementing these algorithms. I havn't finished all yet and i'll keep updating!
